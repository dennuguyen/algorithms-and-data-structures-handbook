# Greedy Method

The greed method solves a problem by dividing it into stages rather than searching all the ways to get from one stage to the next.

Considers the choice that is best at the time so it's not clear whether the locally optimal choice leads to the globally optimal outcome.

## Proving Correctness

### Greedy Stays Ahead

Prove that at every stage, no other algorithm can do better.

### Exchange Argument

Consider an optimal solution and gradually transform it to the solution found by our algorithm without making it worse.
